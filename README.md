# Amensis — Cinematic Landing Page (HTML/CSS/JS)

A dark, high‑contrast one‑page website template designed for a horror game landing page.

## What changed
- More “cinematic” layout: fullscreen hero, centered section headings, clean panels
- Player‑facing copy (no full story spoilers on the page)
- Feature blocks focusing on mechanics: instant camera, zoom/focus, psychological horror, puzzles
- Trailer placeholder + screenshots grid
- Sticky topbar that becomes solid on scroll

## How to run
1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Open `amensis-site/index.html` in your browser, or use VS Code + Live Server.

## Files
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`
- `assets/amensis-logo.webp` (logo used in header + hero)

## Replace placeholders
- Store links in the HERO section
- Social links
- Trailer iframe `src` inside the MEDIA section
- Screenshot placeholders (swap for real images)
